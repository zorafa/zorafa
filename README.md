## 🌟 Current Project   

### 🤖 **Custom AI for Intrusion Detection**  
Development of an artificial intelligence system designed to detect network intrusions in real-time. The AI is trained on both simulated and real-world data, using supervised classification algorithms (Neural Networks).  
The system is capable of:  
- Identifying abnormal network behaviors.  
- Categorizing threats (e.g., DDoS attacks, network scans, etc.).  
- Providing real-time alerts via a Flask API interface connected to a dashboard.  

**Goal**: Enhance proactive security by automating network monitoring in enterprise environments.
